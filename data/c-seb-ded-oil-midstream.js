Take a port terminal that handles crude oil alongside biofuels or chemicals. Whether it is dedicated to oil is arguable, and the policy does not say how SEB decides. A mixed terminal can be treated as outside this commitment.\n\nExisting assets are covered in part. SEB's definition of “New Project” counts capacity expansions and material changes.
